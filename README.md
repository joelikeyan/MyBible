Add a timeline view for biblical events into the app. I'd love to see what it translates into. Show me the gematria (the number of a name). It would be like a little addition thing: 10 + 300. So if you touch geometry, then you get the + 300, and then it equals and gives you a number that's the gematria of that word and a concordance alphabet.
